# 🤖 Discord Bot Sample

I made this as a **simple Discord bot sample**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, to use this, you need to create a Discord bot by going to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Then, download the modules mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.

⚠️ Some functions may not work if the permissions given to the bot do not satisfy the features added to it.

Feel free to change the syntax and functions to your liking.

Also, don't forget to change the Discord bot token in the `.env` file.

## 📋 Overview

The Discord bot contains the following functions:

- ⚡ Assign and remove the role **admin**  
- ⚡ Send a specific DM to the author of the command  
- ⚡ Reply to the message sent by the author  
- ⚡ Delete and send a warning message if someone uses a bad word (expandable by maintaining a separate restricted words file for your server)  
- ⚡ Welcome message for new users  
- ⚡ Poll creation (*not real*, just an embedded message)  
- ⚡ A command only usable if the author has a certain rank  

Explore even more functionalities on the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

> **Note:**  
> The bot will go offline if the computer running it is turned off or if the code is stopped.  
> For 24/7 uptime, consider using cloud hosting services.
